- âš¡ Fun fact: Astronomers recently discovered a superfast-pulsing radio source unlike any other!  This object, called GPM J1839-10, located in the Scutum constellation, emits a short burst of radio waves every 22 minutes â€“ that's way slower than typical pulsars which can spin thousands of times per second.  Here's the twist:  GPM J1839-10 has been doing this for at least 3 decades, based on archival data!  Scientists are baffled by this slow, steady pulse and are currently investigating if it's a neutron star, white dwarf, or something entirely new!
